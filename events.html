					    	<p class="para">
					    		Ice hockey is a team sport played on ice in which skaters use sticks to shoot a hard rubber hockey puck into their opponent's net to score points. In some countries, such as Canada, the United States and a few European countries such as Finland and Sweden among others, it is known as "hockey"; the name "ice hockey" is used in countries where "hockey" generally refers to field hockey (like in most European, South American and Asian countries).

						<h3>Curling</h3>

							<img src="img/curling.jpg" alt="Curling" /><br />
							<p class="para">
					    	Curling is a sport in which players slide stones on a sheet of ice towards a target area which is segmented into four concentric rings. It is related to bowls, boules and shuffleboard. Two teams, each of four players, take turns sliding heavy, polished granite stones, also called rocks, across the ice curling sheet towards the house, a circular target marked on the ice. Each team has eight stones. The purpose is to accumulate the highest score for a game; points are scored for the stones resting closest to the centre of the house at the conclusion of each end, which is completed when both teams have thrown all of their stones. A game may consist of ten or eight ends.

					 	<h3>Speed Skating</h3>

					  		<img src="img/speed-skating.jpg" alt="Speed Skating" /><br />
							<p class="para">
					    	Speed skating is a competitive form of ice skating in which the competitors race each other in travelling a certain distance on skates. Types of speed skating are long track speed skating, short track speed skating, and marathon speed skating. In the Olympic Games, long-track speed skating is usually referred to as just "speed skating", while short-track speed skating is known as "short track". The ISU, the governing body of both ice sports, refers to long track as "speed skating" and short track as "short track skating".

					  		<img src="img/ski-jumping.jpg" alt="Ski Jumping" /><br />
							<p class="para">
					    	Ski jumping is a sport in which skiers go down a take-off ramp, jump, and attempt to fly as far as possible. Judges award points for technique (often referred to as style points). The skis used for ski jumping are wide and long (260 to 275 centimetres (102 to 108 in)). Ski jumping is predominantly a winter sport, performed on snow, and is part of the Winter Olympic Games, but can also be performed in summer on artificial surfaces â€“ porcelain or frost rail track on the inrun, plastic on the landing hill. Ski jumping belongs to the Nordic type of competitive skiing.

					  	<h3>Bobsleigh</h3>

					  	<div>
					  		<img src="img/bobsleigh.jpg" alt="Bobsleigh" /><br />
							<p class="para">
					    		Bobsleigh or bobsled is a winter sport in which teams of two or four make timed runs down narrow, twisting, banked, iced tracks in a gravity-powered sled. The timed runs are combined to calculate the final score. The various types of sleds came several years before the first tracks were built in St. Moritz, Switzerland, where the original bobsleds were adapted upsized luge/skeleton sleds designed by the adventurously wealthy to carry passengers. All three types were adapted from boys' delivery sleds and toboggans.

					  		<img src="img/figure-skating.jpg" alt="Figure Skating" /><br />
							<p class="para">
					    		Figure skating is a sport and activity in which individuals, duos, or groups perform on figure skates on ice. It was the first winter sport included in the Olympics, in 1908. The four Olympic disciplines are men's singles, ladies' singles, pair skating, and ice dancing. Non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating and four skating. In senior-level competition, skaters generally perform two programs (short and long) which, depending on the discipline, may include spins, jumps, moves in the field, lifts, throw jumps, death spirals, and other elements or moves.
